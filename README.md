## Description

A lot of my friends complain to me that they can't read books and that they're movie-people, more so when the book costs in excess of a thousand rupees. 

This is why they never got around to reading the Watchmen comics (one of the greatest comic books of all time). And so why not just play the movie over the book?
Read when you want to, watch the movie when you need to. Makes more sense in my head. But why not just have some fun.
